# OOCP
[Wiki](https://github.com/HomeAutomationComponents/OOCP/wiki/General)

The OOCP "Object orientet communication protocol" is a smart home project,
which I started during my studies to integrate various devices into my smart home.

It is based, similar to the BACnet protocol, on objects which can maintain a large number of properties.
